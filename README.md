# 📧 Email Spam Classifier

This project builds a machine learning model to classify emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning algorithms.

## 🚀 Features
- Email text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stemming/lemmatization)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Model training using Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression / SVM
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Predict new emails through a simple function or script

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

└── email.csv                  # email dataset (spam/ham)
```

## 📊 Dataset
- Public dataset like **SpamAssassin Public Corpus** or **UCI SMS Spam Collection Dataset**.
- The dataset includes labeled emails/texts as spam (1) or ham (0).

## 🔧 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-spam-classifier.git
   cd email-spam-classifier
   ```
2. Install required libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook spam_classifier.ipynb
   ```

## ✅ How to Use
- Preprocess the email text using the provided functions.
- Load the trained model or retrain it on the dataset.
- Call the `predict(email_text)` function to classify a new email.

## 📈 Results
- Achieved an accuracy of **XX%** on the test dataset.
- The classifier shows strong performance in detecting spam emails while minimizing false positives.

Would you like me to also create a sample `requirements.txt` file and a short example code snippet (like `predict("Congratulations! You've won a prize.")`) to make the GitHub project even better? 🎯
